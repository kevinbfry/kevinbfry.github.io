I like to eat pizza on weekends. $\mathrm{Pr}(\text{eat pizza Sat}) = .3$ and
$\mathrm{Pr}(\text{eat pizza Sun}) = .4$. What is the probability that I will eat pizza on a given
weekend? Provide bounds and explain.

This is a exercise in basic probability. If the events are disjoint, then $\mathrm{Pr}(\text{eat pizza on weekend}) = .7$. On the other hand, if they are nested, then $\mathrm{Pr}(\text{eat pizza on weekend}) = .4$.
