  <summary>Solution</summary>
  This is just a basic question to query if you have basic 
  familiarity with neural networks. You should mention techniques 
  such as dropout, data augmentation, and early stopping.

  You may also want to mention that additional regularization techniques 
  may not be necessary, as there is theory suggesting that training with 
  (stochastic) gradient descent implicitly regularizes the solution.
